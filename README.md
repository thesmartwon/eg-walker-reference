# Eg-walker (reference implementation)

This is a fork that uses Bun as a test runner and simplifies `causal-graph.ts`
by removing unused functions and RLE. It adds classes for readability and
removes most comments.

It also adds a small demo editor.

The purpose of this is really just for me to learn so I can make my own CC0-1.0
eg-walker implementation.
